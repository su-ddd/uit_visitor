University IT Visitor Modules for Drupal 7.x

-- SUMMARY --

Author: Marco Wise

These modules are meant to find out information about visitors to the Stanford
University IT website and reach appropriately (adding session variables, 
assigning Drupal roles, etc.)

For example, if someone is looking for instructions on configuring their email
account, the modules can discover in advance which email service they are on
(Zimbra, Google, Office 365, etc.) so that the appropriate instructions are
displayed.
